**Web Application Infrastructure on AWS**


This repository contains CloudFormation templates to deploy a scalable and resilient web application infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
The infrastructure is designed to host a web application that consists of multiple components, including a virtual private cloud (VPC), 
public and private subnets, an internet-facing load balancer, auto-scaling group, and associated security groups.
